In this challenge, we have to get the flag from a bot.

The bot's source code can be found from the author's github. https://github.com/itsecgary/ChungusBot

From the source code we can find the commands to give to the bot to get the flag. The commands are:
```
>chungusboi kyle
>flag yeeee
>chungy mcchungus
>gagagaga chungusisgod
>gagagaga giveittome
```

The flag is `UMDCTF-{I_th1nk_y0u_4r3_th3_b0t_n0w_sh3333333333sh}`.
