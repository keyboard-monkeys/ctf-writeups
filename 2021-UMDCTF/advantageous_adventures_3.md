This is the third challenge of the advantageous adventures series.

The WiFi password obtained in the first part can be passed into wireshark, which then decrypts the messages from the packet capture from the second part. The first of the messages (after establishing a connection) all contain the flag `UMDCTF-{wp@_!s_3z}`.
