The challenge text is:

*AC01010 and JC01010's long lost twin has joined the [HSCTF discord](https://discord.gg/C9UMj3qN8a) and started a Youtube channel! Although they haven't uploaded any videos, they've made some customizations to some of their video watermarks.*

*Please respect the privacy of our organizers and do not OSINT any of our organizers. None of the flags are hidden on our own social media sites or other accounts. This challenge includes BC01010 and this person only. Do not visit any other profiles, including JC01010, AC, or any other organizers. Thank you.*

The discord profile of BC01010 was connected to the youtube channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqZq81jZcdjAHQJ3UtAbdaA. The channel contains no videos or description, only a playlist. So we can't find watermarks from the channel's videos.

We can find another channel's watermark image url, for example https://i.ytimg.com/an/h0zL67h0-poLXYfV0IFkww/featured_channel.jpg. Then we can change the channel id to be correct and get the watermark we are looking for: https://i.ytimg.com/an/qZq81jZcdjAHQJ3UtAbdaA/featured_channel.jpg. The flag is in the picture.
