The provided code runs the input through four functions (the output from each one being passed to the next one), checking the end result against a fixed string. The original string can be found by reversing the functions and passing the string and intermediate results through the functions backwards.

However, as a twist, one of the functions - `warm` can actually produce the same output for multiple different inputs. Thus, multiple cases have to be checked for that. Solver:

```python3

def revCold(s):
    return s[-17:] + s[:-17]

def revCool(s):
    o = ""
    for i, c in enumerate(s):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            o += chr(ord(c) - 3 * (i // 2))
        else:
            o += c
    return o

def revWarm(s):
    l = s.index('l')
    a = s[l+1:]
    for si in range(l):
        c = s[:si]
        b = s[si:l+1]
        yield a + b + c
    

def revHot(s):
    o = ""
    adj = [-72, 7, -58, 2, -33, 1, -102, 65, 13, -64, 
	   21, 14, -45, -11, -48, -7, -1, 3, 47, -65, 3, -18, 
	   -73, 40, -27, -73, -13, 0, 0, -68, 10, 45, 13]
    for c, a in zip(s, adj):
        o += chr(ord(c) - a)
    return o
    
encr = "4n_3nd0th3rm1c_rxn_4b50rb5_3n3rgy"

s1 = revHot(encr)

for s2 in revWarm(s1):
    res = revCold(revCool(s2))
    if "flag" in res:
        print(res)
```

Most of these cases end up generating noise, but one does generate a valid flag: `flag{1ncr34s3_1n_3nth4lpy_0f_5y5}`.
